# Introduction

## Welcome to the journey from a mobile app to a web or desktop app.

As you can remember, since March 2021, Flutter has become a multi-platform framework, and applications can be created not only for mobile but also for web and desktop. However, web and desktop applications have a few significant differences. For example, mobile applications only need to support touch screens. If you're building a web or desktop application, you need to support keyboard and mouse control as well. In this workshop, we are going to remake a simple mobile application into a desktop app. Along the way, we will figure out how to manage focus properly and what a hover effect is.
Let's prototype an e-commerce application. The application should have a gallery with a list of products. Tapping on a product opens a screen with detailed information, and a long tap displays a dialog with brief details. Since we donâ€™t have any actual products, we will use the numbers from 0 to 7.

On a mobile device, everything works well. However, if the application is launched in a browser or on a desktop, then issues in UX will immediately be visible, because users expect more from mobile and web apps:

- First, keyboard support, so that the keyboard can control the selection of the current element.
- Second, when hovering the mouse, it should be clear that the element is clickable, so it should somehow be highlighted.

Let's run it in Dartpad and check. To do this, just select the appropriate target in your IDE and press Run.

None of the above is happening, so let's try to fix it.

## Support out of the box

The easiest fix for these issues is changing `GestureDetector` to `InkWell`, because `InkWell` supports focusing and hovering out of the box.

Please make this change, reload the app and check.

Now when you hover the mouse pointer to the element, the mouse cursor is changed. You can also move the focus by keyboard and open the details page by pressing Enter key. Unfortunately, the selection of the active element is hardly noticeable, and it would be better to have a brighter hover effect, so let's figure out how to implement our own hover effect and focus control.
# Important

1. To check focus keyboard control is working, make sure to "Run" your code, click inside the "UI Output" window, then hit the `Tab` key.
2. DartPad has **Flutter for Web** under the hood, so you can use the `Tab` key only for focus moving. If you copy the code and run it in IDE for Desktop, you will be able to use arrow keys as well.

PS: If you don't need to highlight a focus and hover effect you can set [`FocusHighLightStrategy`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FocusManager/highlightStrategy.html) to `FocusHighlightStrategy.alwaysTouch`, so that focus highlights will only appear on widgets that bring up a soft keyboard.

```dart
FocusManager.instance.highlightStrategy = FocusHighlightStrategy.alwaysTouch;
```
