# Conclusions

## Congrats, you've done it!

The workshop hasnâ€™t been not easy, but in the process of going through it, you have solved many different tasks related to Web and Desktop specific user interaction tasks.

So, you've learned how to:

1. Control mouse hover effect and focus and make them animated
2. Listen to keyboard presses and long-presses and handle them directly using callbacks
3. Use shortcuts and actions to separate keyboard intents and actions
4. Change default keyboard settings 
5. Create custom activator to handle long-presses using shortcuts.
6. Use mega-widget FocusableActionDetector to make everything look more tidy.
